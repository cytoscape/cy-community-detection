Community Detection APplication and Service (CDAPS)

CDAPS performs multiscale community detection and
functional enrichment for network analysis
through a service-oriented architecture.
These features are provided by integrating

enrichment tools. All the algorithms and
tools run remotely on a dedicated server.

Currently supported features:

* Community detection algorithms: Louvain, Infomap, OSLOM, CliXO
* Functional enrichment tools: g:Profiler, Enrichr, iQuery
