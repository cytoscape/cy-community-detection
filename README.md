Community Detection App is a Cytoscape App that leverages third party algorithms (via [REST service][cdservice])
to perform [hierarchical clustering/community detection][cd] on a given network. Leveraging
the [REST service][cdservice] allows incorporation of algorithms not easily portable/distributable
with this App. In addition, this tool offers for biologists Term Mapping/Enrichment (also via [service][cdservice]) on the
hierarchies generated by this App.

**NOTE:** This service is experimental. The interface is subject to change.
